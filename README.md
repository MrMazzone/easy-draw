# Setup

It's easy!  Just download ```easy_draw.py``` and include it in your project directory. 

Currently, the module is not on PyPI so it is not pip installable. Thus, you must download the ```easy_draw.py``` file.

# What is Easy Draw?

Easy Draw is a simple to use Python module that allows you to create simple graphics primitives (rectangles, circles, polygons, etc.) with Python functions.

It is designed to be used with students that only know how to make function calls with Python code. 

After learning more about Python (conditionals, iteration, and functions), students can use Easy Draw to make simple animations and games!

# About the Project
Easy Draw was created by Joe Mazzone, Computer and Software Engineering instructor at William M. Davies, Jr. Career and Technical High School in Lincoln, Rhode Island. 

The project was created to introduce Davies' students to GUI development early in an introductory Python course.  GUIs are how students interact with software.  Let's get them to build GUIs earlier and generate more interest in Computer Science and programming!
